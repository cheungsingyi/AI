# Security and Privacy Audit Report

## Overview
This report presents the findings from a security and privacy audit of the Markdown documentation files in the `readme` folder. The audit focused on identifying any sensitive data, API keys, credentials, or other potential data leakage issues.

## Findings

### 1. API Key Exposure in `agents.md`

**Issue**: Hardcoded Tavily API key exposed in code block
**Location**: `/home/jack/coding_project/2025/chainlit/chatbot2/readme/agents.md` (Line 11)
**Severity**: High
**Details**: The file contains a hardcoded Tavily API key in the code block:
```python
tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="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")
```

### 2. Environment Variables in `rag.md`

**Issue**: References to environment variables for API keys
**Location**: `/home/jack/coding_project/2025/chainlit/chatbot2/readme/rag.md` (Lines 35, 42, 84)
**Severity**: Low
**Details**: The file references environment variables for API keys, but does not expose actual keys:
```python
api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
api_key=os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY")
```

## Recommendations

1. **Remove Hardcoded API Key**:
   - Replace the hardcoded Tavily API key in `agents.md` with an environment variable reference:
   ```python
   tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key=os.getenv("TAVILY_API_KEY"))
   ```

2. **Add Security Notes**:
   - Add a security note to documentation files mentioning that users should set up their own API keys as environment variables
   - Include instructions on how to securely manage API keys

3. **Review Original Source Files**:
   - Ensure the original Python files (`agents.py`, etc.) also use environment variables instead of hardcoded API keys

4. **Add .env Template**:
   - Create a `.env.example` file showing required environment variables without actual values

## Conclusion

The documentation files generally follow good security practices by using environment variables for sensitive data. However, one hardcoded API key was found in `agents.md` that should be removed to prevent potential misuse. This appears to be a direct conversion from the original Python file, suggesting that the source code may also contain this hardcoded key.

No other sensitive data issues were identified in the documentation files.
